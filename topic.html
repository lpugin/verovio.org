    With some browsers, like Firefox, you can run it by opening the HTML file in the browser. With other browsers, like Chrome, you might need to run a server because of CORS restrictions : in the terminal, go to the folder where the HTML file is and type the following command : <code>python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8003</code> (Python 2) or <code>python -m http.server 8003</code> (Python 3). To find out which version of Python you have installed type: <code>python --version</code>. The file will then be available on <code>http://localhost:8003</code>. Alternatively, you can use a local server such as XAMPP.
